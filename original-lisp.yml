title: Implementing (the original) Lisp in Python
description: "To understand what Lisp is all about, let's go back to the roots and 
    have a look at John McCarthy's original Lisp. By implementing it in Python we see 
    how, with just a few basic operators and a simple concept of functions, we're able 
    to implement the rest of the language within itself."
